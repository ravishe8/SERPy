**SERPy** tries to parse user queries from natural language to **S**QL, **E**xcel, **R** and **Py**thon.
This app is based upon a LLM-powered chatbot, and is built using:
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) UI
- [HugChat](https://github.com/Soulter/hugging-chat-api) API
- [OpenAssistant/oasst-sft-6-llama-30b-xor](https://huggingface.co/OpenAssistant/oasst-sft-6-llama-30b-xor) LLM model

**When you use this app, it means that you have agreed to the following two requirements of the HuggingChat:**
1. AI is an area of active research with known problems such as biased generation and misinformation. Do not use this application for high-stakes decisions or advice.
2. Your conversations will be shared with model authors.
